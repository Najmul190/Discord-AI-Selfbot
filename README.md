# ü§ñ Discord AI Selfbot

This is a [Python](https://www.python.org)-based Discord selfbot using the `discord.py-self` library. The selfbot automatically responds to messages that mention it's trigger word and holds conversations using Groq API's Llama-3, one of the highest performing models, **all for completely free**. You can also add your own API key for ChatGPT functionality, but this is not required. It functions as a normal Discord bot, but on a real Discord account, allowing other people to talk to it within DMs, servers and even group chats without you needing to invite a bot or add the bot to the server - making it seem like a real user to others.

> There is always the slight risk of a ban when using selfbots, so make sure to use this selfbot on an account you don't mind losing, but the risk is incredibly low and I have used it for over a year without any issues.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:**  
*I take no responsibility for any actions taken against your account for using these selfbots or how users use my open-source code.*


<strong>Using this on a user account is prohibited by the [Discord TOS](https://discord.com/terms) and can lead to your account getting banned in _very_ rare cases.</strong>

### Step 5: Install all the dependencies and run the bot

Windows:

-   Simply open `run.bat` if you're on Windows. This will install all pre-requisites, guide you through the process of setting up the bot and run it for you.

-   If `run.bat` doesn't work, then open CMD and run `cd Discord-AI-Selfbot` to change directory to the bot files directory
-   Create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv bot-env`
-   Activate the virtual environment by running `bot-env\Scripts\activate.bat`
-   Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies
-   Fill out `example.env` with your own credentials and rename it to `.env`
-   Fill out the `config.yaml` file with your own settings
-   Run the bot using `python3 main.py`

Linux:

-   If you're on Linux, then run `cd the\bot\files\directory` to change directory to the bot files directory
-   Create a virtual environment by running `python3 -m venv bot-env`
-   Activate the virtual environment by running `source bot-env/bin/activate`
-   Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies
-   Fill out `example.env` with your own credentials and rename it to `.env`
-   Fill out the `config.yaml` file with your own settings

# üó®Ô∏è How to talk to the bot

-   To activate it in a channel use **~toggleactive channelid** (channelid is optional).
-   To see all commands use **~help**
-   Bear in mind that the bot will only respond to **other accounts** and not itself, including any commands.
-   You must also set a trigger word within the `config.yaml`, this is the word that the bot will respond to. For example, if you set the trigger word to `John`, people must say "Hey `John`, how are you today?" for the bot to respond.


# üí≠ Changing the Personality of the bot

To change the personality of the bot and set custom instructions, simply go into the `config` folder and edit the default instructions in `instructions.txt` to whatever you want!
